React is basically a framework provided by Node Js, which is provide user for advance User Interface components. when we see a website page, different section are diff components. for e.g on facebook post, we see a user photo and name, this is one component, then post text and images, this is second component, and all the likes, comment, dislike button consider as third component. In monolithic system, these components are not seperated, thus hard t o dubug. but in microservices, these components are seperated out and thus easier to debug. React framework is developed by facebook for such advance feature. Reac DOM is used for website while react native is used to develop mobile app. used Notepad++ as editor, and  developer command prompt VS for "npm", we can use this with command prompt also
